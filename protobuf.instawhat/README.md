## Instawhat
Instawhat is a social network where a user can post a photograph they found on the internet by providing its public URL. For that photograph, other users can comment, rate, or give it a "like." Additionally, the user who posted the photo can delete it from the social network, although it will still exist on the external site. The social network only allows you to see the last 20 photos published by any user.

Design the protocol. Then, implement this application in Python with sockets and Protocol Buffers.

### Requirements
